# Humanity and Powerful AI

## Frontier Model Forum

The [Frontier Model Forum](https://www.frontiermodelforum.org) is an industry-supported non-profit focused on addressing significant risks to public safety and national security. We have three core mandates: 
1. Identify best practices and support standards development.
2. Advance science and independent research.
3. Facilitate information sharing among government, academia, civil society and industry.

    - **Avoid doomerism**: The lesson is that we need to discuss and address risks in a realistic, pragmatic manner: sober, fact-based, and well equipped to survive changing tides.
    - **Acknowledge uncertainty**: No one can predict the future with complete confidence—but we have to do the best we can to plan anyway.
    - **Intervene as surgically as possible**: The most constructive thing we can do today is advocate for limited rules while we learn whether or not there is evidence to support stronger ones.
    - **What should you be worried about?**: Autonomy risks, Misuse for destruction, Misuse for seizing power, Economic disruption, and Indirect effects.
2. [Machines of Loving Grace1, October 2024](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace) - By powerful AI, I have in mind an AI model — likely similar to today’s LLMs in form, though it might be based on a different architecture, might involve several interacting models, and might be trained differently—with the following properties:
    - In terms of pure intelligence4, it is **smarter than a Nobel Prize winner** across most relevant fields – biology, programming, math, engineering, writing, etc.
    - It **has all the “interfaces” available to a human working virtually**, including text, audio, video, mouse and keyboard control, and internet access. It can engage in any actions, communications, or remote operations enabled by this interface, including taking actions on the internet, taking or giving directions to humans, ordering materials, directing experiments, watching videos, making videos, and so on.
    - It **can be given tasks** that take hours, days, or weeks to complete, and then goes off and **does those tasks autonomously**.
    - It **does not have a physical embodiment, but it can control existing physical tools**, robots, or laboratory equipment...
    - The resources used to train the **model can be repurposed to run millions of instances of it**, and the model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x-100x human speed.
    - Each of these million copies **can act independently on unrelated tasks, or if needed can all work together**in the same way humans would collaborate
